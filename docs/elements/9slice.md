# NineSliceSprite

NineSliceSprite allows you to express a "nine-slice sprite," a feature that smoothes out stretching by splitting a single texture into nine pieces.

This is a feature that has been incorporated into many other game engines. For more information, please refer to [Unity Description](https://docs.unity3d.com/ja/current/Manual/9SliceSprites.html).


```cs
// Generated by specifying the path and the number of pixels from the top left, right, and bottom edges
var sprite = new NineSliceSprite("./path/to/sprite.png", 16, 16, 16, 16);

DF.Root.Add(sprite);

// Resizing will smoothly resize the image
sprite.Width = 256;
sprite.Height = 300;
```
